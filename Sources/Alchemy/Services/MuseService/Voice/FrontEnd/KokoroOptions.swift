//
//  KokoroOptions.swift
//  Alchemy — ported from Ambient's AmbientVoice (1cb03fc)
//
//  WHAT: What the on-device voice does around the model call, one switch per
//        piece, so a render can put each against what shipped before it.
//  IN:   KokoroEngine.options (the app), the probe's --legacy / --options
//  OUT:  KokoroPhonemizer (punctuation, function words), KokoroEngine+Render
//        (segments, style vector, seams)
//  PIN:  `.legacy` is byte for byte the voice before these switches existed,
//        kept for the probe's A/B. Since 2026-10-31 nothing in the app speaks
//        it: the hosted voice's cover runs on the standard render, so a
//        covered chunk has the same seams and level as every other.
